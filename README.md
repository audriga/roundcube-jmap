# Roundcube JMAP
The JMAP plugin for Roundcube provides [JMAP](https://jmap.io/) support for Roundcube by exposing a RESTful API Endpoint which speaks the JMAP Protocol. Use it to sync user data via a JMAP-compatible client such as OpenXPort or [lttrs-cli](https://github.com/iNPUTmice/lttrs-cli) (coming soon).

The following data types are currently supported by the JMAP Plugin for Roundcube:

* Contacts over the JMAP for Contacts protocol
* Calendars over the JMAP for Calendars protocol, built on top of the [JSCalendar](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-calext-jscalendar-32) format

## Installation
1. ‚òÅ Clone this plugin into the `plugins` folder of your Roundcube: `git clone https://github.com/audriga/jmap-roundcube jmap` (Make sure the folder is named `jmap`)
1. ‚úÖ In the folder of the plugin, move the `jmap.php` file into the Roundcube root folder
1. üë©‚Äçüíª Run `composer install --prefer-dist --no-dev`
1. üéâ Partytime! Help fix [some issues](https://github.com/audriga/jmap-roundcube/issues) and [send us some pull requests](https://github.com/audriga/jmap-roundcube/pulls) üëç

## Usage
Set up your favorite client to talk to Nextclouds JMAP API.

## Development
### Installation
1. Leave out `--no-dev` and run `composer install --prefer-dist` instead

### Tests
Run PHP CodeSniffer via
```
$ phpcs .
```

Run PHPUnit via
```
$ phpunit -c tests/phpunit.xml
```

For debugging purposes it makes sense to throw some cURL calls at the API. For example, this is how you tell the JMAP API to return all Contacts:

```
curl <roundcube-address>/jmap.php -u <username>:<password> -d '{"using":["urn:ietf:params:jmap:calendars"],"methodCalls":[["Contact/get", {"accountId":"<username>"}, "0"]]}'
```
